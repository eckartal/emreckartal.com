> We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. - Kurt Vonnegut

I'd like to pretend to be someone who’s curious about humans, patterns in how we interact with the world, and the machines we build. Pretending is the first step to becoming.

Hi, I'm Emre. I have a background in anthropology and a fascination with technology. 

This blog is where I work through ideas—an open notebook for thoughts, frameworks, and experiments. It's a place to track how I change over time and, maybe, to spark convos.

What you'll find here:

- My approach to products and marketing
- Thoughts on wealth—investing your time and money
- The intersection of anthropology and AI
- Some of my paintings

Writing helps me think, and maybe reading will do the same for you.

Best,
Emre
