> We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be. - Kurt Vonnegut

I'd like to pretend to be a person who is curious about something related to humans and patterns of our interaction with our surroundings and machines.
*and a good way to start a blog is to quote some wise words resonate with one's ideas.*

I'm Emre, a tech enthusiast with an anthropology background. Keep reading [About](https://emreckartal.com) page to learn more about me.

I've created this blog to stack my thoughts, frameworks, the things I'd like to start in order to see how I change over time. 

So this is my open notebook where my ideas and plans first take shape—a place where I can think through writing on my own.

What I'd like to share about:
- my product/marketing approach 
- wealth in my perspective - investing your time and money
- anthropology and AI
- and some of my paintings

Best,
Emre
