I'm a tech enthusiast with an anthropology background. I enjoy tinkering and growing companies from zero to one.

I'm a team member at [Homebrew Research](https://homebrew.ltd/), a local AI company that is creator and lead maintainer of [Jan](https://jan.ai) and [Cortex](https://cortex.so). We also train open-source AI models (e.g. [Ichigo](https://github.com/homebrewltd/ichigo)) and tinker with hardware.

I'm just observing, learning and doing. I've been working since age 14 -mostly alongside entrepreneurs and investors- to help their businesses become both profitable and respected. 

## Current curiosities:

- [Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ex28j0/comment/lj2ttfz/): Some might say it’s not the best time, but I disagree
- [SBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer): Tinkering with on-device AI to be opinionated about robotics
- 中文: To talk in hardware language

## Achievements I'm proud of:

- Since 2012: Helped some friends toward their first customers
- 2024: Reached 2M+ downloads for [an AI desktop app](https://jan.ai)
- 2023: Helped shape an [eCommerce analytics company](https://www.heybooster.ai/) from messaging to sales narratives
- 2023: Began traveling through Southeast Asia with my wife to experience new ways of life
- 2022: Contributed to organizing [the largest game-industry conference](https://mobidictum.com/events/mobidictum-business-conference-2022/) in Turkiye & MENA
- 2019: Helped build [the biggest esports media platform](https://www.playerbros.com/) in Turkiye
