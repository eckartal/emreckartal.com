I'm a tech enthusiast with an anthropology background, passionate about creating narratives that drive ethical growth for ventures I have a stake in.

I'm a team member at [Homebrew Research](https://homebrew.ltd/), a local AI company that is creators and lead maintainers of [Jan](https://jan.ai) and [Cortex](https://cortex.so). We also train open-source AI models and tinker with hardware.

I'm just observing, learning and doing. I've been working since age 14 -mostly alongside entrepreneurs and investors- to help their businesses become both profitable and respected. 

## Current curiosities:

- [Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ex28j0/comment/lj2ttfz/): Some might say it’s not the best time, but I disagree
- [SBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer): for on-device AI that we can tinker with
- 中文: To talk in hardware language

## Achievements I'm proud of:

- Since 2012: Helped some folks toward their first customers & revenue
- 2023: Helped pivot an eCommerce analytics company from sales narrative to socials
- 2023: Began traveling through Southeast Asia to find the place that resonates most with me and my spouse
- 2022: Contributed to organizing the largest game-industry conference in MENA
- 2019: Built the biggest esports media platform in Turkiye
